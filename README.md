# LLM-Bash-Assistant

As a Linux user who frequently used commandline, I often browse forums to solve my problems. It works, but I'd like to find a way that let me get help without internet. Books and manual pages are there already but they are not interactive. Enter LLM; this is my attempt at creating LLMs to assist Linux commandline operations. Based on this idea, I built two programs : 
1. ask.py : A simple Python script to access Hugging Face Linux command generator custom model, no learning ability.
2. LLMan : Large Language Man, LLM model that learns from manual pages implemented in AnythingLLM.
