## LLMan
_By the time of writing this, I don't know if I can export Anything LLM Agents. In the meantime, I simply provide a tutorial to configure it inside AnythingLLM_

**Preparation**
Make sure your laptop can run LLM locally. The minimum requirements for LLMs are, NVIDIA 3000+ GPU RTX, Intel i7 processor with 8+ cores, RAM 16+GB, and 100+GB of free space. 

Install AythingLLM on your desktop. Click the icon according your OS type and wait for the download to finish.

**Configuration**
Convert all of your system commands manual pages into .txt files. The process should take around few minutes. 

Open AnythingLLM and create your workspace. 

Upload files to your workspace. Click `all custom documents`
